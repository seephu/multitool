# multitool
A Flask web app developed during my co-op term that serves network automation scripts.

Some example tools include:
* Network configuration generators for Cisco IOS-XR/XE & Juniper JunOS
* Utilities to automate data entry (a regular ~4-5 hour task now brought down to 1 hour.)
* Various SSH utilities e.g. querying our network's routing table as a final verification before deploying statically routed circuits
